/**
 * The interface of a cache.
 * <p>
 * A cache is a facility which reads data from a underlying data source, and
 * store them in the memory in order to provide fast access.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The cache may store all data in the memory, or just store some amount of data
 * in the memory, depending on its caching policy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The cache may fetch a piece of data from the data source a time, or fetch a
 * batch of data a time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Sometime the cached data may be abandoned, if they satisfy some condition
 * (i.e., too old, too little access frequency, etc). If the client request the
 * abandoned data again, the cache will fetch the data from the underlying data
 * source again.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The implementation do NOT need to be thread-safe. In order to get a
 * thread-safe cache, use the {@link SynchronizedCache} to wrap a non
 * thread-safe {@link Cache} object.
 * </p>
